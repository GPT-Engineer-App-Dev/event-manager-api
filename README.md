# event-manager-api

Create a new Vite project using the Chakra UI template. Set up a basic responsive layout with:

- A header component with the app name "Event Manager"
- A main content area component 
- A footer component with a copyright notice

Don't worry about any routing, pages, or extra folders yet. Just create the basic layout components in the existing file structure.
