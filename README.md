# event-manager-api

Create a new Vite project using the Chakra UI template. Set up a basic responsive layout with:

- A header with the app name "Event Manager" and a login/register button
- A main content area 
- A footer with a copyright notice

Also create a folder structure for the auth pages and components:

- src/pages/Login.jsx 
- src/pages/Register.jsx
- src/components/LoginForm.jsx
- src/components/RegisterForm.jsx

For now just put placeholder text in those files.
